# JaxNeRF

## Proposal

The project is based on jax and hiaku,
aiming to provide python interface for training(quantization), rendering and hardware verfication.

Besides implementing origin instant ngp algorithm,
i will implement new octree based algorithm with jax for further quantization and verfication.
